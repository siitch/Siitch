# About this branch

This branch is the integration of the latest features with **Expo** support that allows you to test Siitch real time on 
a real device using Expo Go app with or without a mac. Of course, you can still test it on a simulator like before using
the method Expo provides without having to do any pod installation or XCode project management.

If you run it on a simulator with m1 chip mac, the app will crash during image prediction (After you hit camera button).
